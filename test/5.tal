( Example that calculates 6*7 using 8-bit integers, byte in Java )
|0100 ( every program starts at address 256 )

#06 ( put 6 on the stack as a byte )
DUP ( duplicate, so there are now two values on the stack, both 6 )
INC ( increment the value on the top of the stack, so 6+1 )
MUL ( multiply the value on the top of the stack, 6, with the value below that, 7 )
#18 DEO ( prints '*' in the terminal, because 42 is the ASCII code for '*' )
( DEO means 'device output' and #18 is the output port for the terminal, like StdOut in Java )
