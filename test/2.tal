#0006 ( put 6 on the stack as a 2-byte )
DUP2 ( duplicate, so there are now two values on the stack, both 6 )
INC2 ( increment the value on the top of the stack, so 6+1 )
MUL2 ( multiply the value on the top of the stack, 6, with the value below that, 7 )
#18 DEO ( prints '*' in the terminal, because 42 is the ASCII code for '*' )
