( A Hello World example )
|0100

	;hello_world

	&while
		DUP2 LDA #18 DEO ( what we do here is read a character from the string and print it
        But the 'k' means we keep the address on the stack as well )
		INC2 DUP2 LDA ( we increment the address and load it to get the next character.
        Again we keep the address on the stack )
        #00 NEQ ( so we test if the character value is not equal to zero )
        ,&while JCN ( JCN means "jump with condition, it means we go back to the label &while as long as the condition is true. The last character in the string is a zero byte, so when we read that the condition is false and we finish )
	POP2 ( clean up the stack )

( Constant strings are usually stored with a label like this )
( In Java this would be 

public static final String hello_world = "Hello, World!";

The reason for the 20 is that in Uxntal, you can't have a space in a string, so you need to write the ASCII value for the space instead. )
@hello_world "Hello, 20 "World! 00
